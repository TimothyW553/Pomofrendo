# Pomofrendo
Instant messaging app to synchronize a Pomodoro study timer with friends

This project currently uses HTML + JavaScript on the frontend and Socket.io + Node.js on the backend.

Currently porting this over to ReactJS frontend.

For now, simply run

```
$ npm i && npm start
```

## TODO: 
- Port to ReactJS frontend
- Generate random room names (similar to skribblio)
- Upload to server hosting

## Node Package Modules Used
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (for backend)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (for communication between clients)
- [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) (for getting current time)
