# Pomofrendo
Instant messaging app to synchronize a Pomodoro study timer with friends

This project currently uses HTML + JavaScript on the frontend and Socket.io + Node.js on the backend.

Currently porting this over to ReactJS frontend.

## TODO: 
- Port to ReactJS frontend
- Generate random room names (similar to skribblio)
- Upload to server hosting

For now, simply run

```
$ npm i && npm start
```
